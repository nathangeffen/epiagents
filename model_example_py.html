# You need to install numpy. Everything else is from the Python
# standard library.
#
# This code differs materially from the C++ version as follows: the number of
# agents is far smaller else it simply takes too long to run.

# This is much more of a song and dance using numpy than the equivalent C++
# standard library code. It is used to initialize the ages of the
# microsimulation model's agents. The proportion of males and females for each
# age up to 90 are drawn from the following distribution. The data is from the
# Thembisa model.
