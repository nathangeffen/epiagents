# Understanding epidemics

## The catastrophic effect of plagues

Intro on Covid (newest)

Thucydides description of the Plague of Athens (oldest reliably recorded?)
What was this plague? How many people died? How did it affect the rest of
the Greek/Persian world? Did it spread to China? Did it change the world?

What Thucydides knew - it was contagious between people.

Also talk about how infectious disease as cause of death has declined through
the 20th/21st century, only to spring up on us again.

How much our knowledge has grown. And how much we still don't know - uncertainty
of statistics. Maybe talk about Ronald Fisher

## Modelling measles

Introduce equation-based vs simulation models

Brian Williams wrote a very cool tutorial on this


## 1918 Flu pandemic

Each disease description would be no more than 3000 words. The point of each
description is to convey the scale of the epidemic and its effect on humanity,
and how it differs from other diseases.

For flu, include the brilliant stats of the Bombay Presidency

## Black Death

## Antonine Plague

## Justinian Plague

## AIDS

## Syphilis

Ask who the greatest orchestral music composers were and most people will answer
Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. A man who should have made it into this list, had
his life not been so prematurely ended is Frans Schubert. Start off with Schubert's story.

## TB

Start off with Jude's death in Jude the Obscure.

## Smallpox

## Polio

## Malaria

## Factors affecting spread of infectious disease

- Type of germ: Virus vs bacteria vs parasite

- Mode of transmission
   - Airborne (Covid, Flu, TB)
   - Rats/Fleas
   - Mosquitoes/Parasites
   - Surfaces
   - Sex (HIV, gonorrhoea)

- Rate of mutation

- Effectiveness of transmission
- Asymptomatic duration
- Symptomatic duration
- Population mixing/density

- Heterogeneity

## Mitigating epidemics

- Medicines
- Condoms
- Vaccines
- Lockdowns
- Masks

# Immune systems

# Germ adaptation

# Modelling infectious disease

## Types of models

### Equation-based vs agent-based

### Stochastic vs deterministic

### Modelling pseudo-science - Michael Levitt, Dark Energy

## Modelling Measles


# Contact tracing

# Against Socrates - an appeal for modesty

# On mortality

We are obsessed with staying alive, but are we focussing on living?
-- Over-exuberant lockdowns
-- Over-exuberant treatment
