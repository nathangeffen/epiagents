    <p>In March 2020 – a few months after the appearance of the Covid-19 pandemic –
        a <a
              href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-16-COVID19-Report-9.pdf">micro
        model</a> by Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College</a> in the UK was
        widely reported in the media. The modellers considered how various
        interventions, such as isolation, quarantining, social distancing and school and
        university closures would affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the pressure on
        hospitals.</p>

    <p>Their report is detailed and nuanced. There is extensive discussion about
        mitigating the effects of Covid-19 — reducing <span class="math
                                                                   inline"><em>R</em></span> but not below 1 — versus suppressing it completely —
        reducing <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> below 1. It also had to
        make a plethora of assumptions given how little was understood about Covid-19 at
        the time.</p>

    <p>Unsurprisingly, as with any model that tries to predict the future, the model
        got some things wrong, such as the time period over which Covid would peak. It
        also didn’t consider that SARS-CoV-2 would mutate and that the epidemic would
        return in waves of differing infectiousness and virulence.</p>

    <p>The report concludes that social distancing would have the largest impact.
        Combining this with isolating infected people and school and university closure
        had “the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of <span
                                                                               class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1</span>”, the authors wrote.</p>

    <p>They also pointed out that, “to avoid a rebound in transmission”, these
        policies would need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine became
        available. They pessimistically predicted this would be 18 months or more, but
        in fact vaccines became available near the end of 2020, although most countries
        wouldn’t start rolling them out until 2021.</p>

    <p>The authors recommended using hospital surveillance to switch these measures
        on and off. Importantly they wrote: “Given local epidemics are not perfectly
        synchronised, local policies are also more efficient and can achieve comparable
        levels of suppression to national policies while being in force for a slightly
        smaller proportion of the time.”</p>

    <p>They were cautious:</p>

    <p>“However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this
        virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which
        the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviours. This means it is
        difficult to be definitive about the likely initial duration of measures which
        will be required, except that it will be several months. Future decisions on
        when and for how long to relax policies will need to be informed by ongoing
        surveillance.”</p>

    <p>They also considered mitigation instead of suppression:</p>

    <p>“Our results show that the alternative relatively short-term (3-month)
        mitigation policy option might reduce deaths seen in the epidemic by up to half,
        and peak healthcare demand by two-thirds. The combination of case isolation,
        household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe
        outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions)
        are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.”</p>

    <p>There is very little emphasis on actual results. The same is true for
        Imperial College’s <a
                               href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/">news
        summary</a> of the report for the general public. This seems to be a sensible
        approach. No model in March 2020, less than three months after Covid-19 had been
        discovered, could rely on sufficient accurate knowledge to predict the future
        with any realistic accuracy. Even when diseases are well-understood, and slow
        moving, like TB and HIV, it is almost impossible to predict future infections
        and mortality with much accuracy.</p>

    <p>What models can do, and what the Imperial College model did, is show the
        approximate magnitude of certain interventions on mitigating or suppressing
        infectious outbreaks.</p>

    <p>Yet the Imperial College model was widely criticised, especially by those
        with an ideology opposed to stringent government intervention.</p>

    <p>In April 2020, the US-based Cato Institute <a
                                                      href="https://www.cato.org/blog/how-one-model-simulated-22-million-us-deaths-covid-19">lambasted</a>
        the model. It criticised its pessimistic predictions, which hadn’t come close to
        being true by that time. “Neither the high infection rate nor the high fatality
        rate holds up under scrutiny.” The article, which echoed the Cato Institute’s
        opposition to lockdowns or any stringent government measures to control the
        epidemic, stated:</p>

    <p>“The trouble with being too easily led by models is we can too easily be
        misled by models. Epidemic models may seem entirely different from economic
        models or climate models, but they all make terrible forecasts if filled with
        wrong assumptions and parameters.”</p>

    <p>Much is made of the model’s estimate of 2.2 million Covid-19 deaths in the US
        in the absence of any interventions, something the modelling report correctly
        did <strong>not</strong> emphasise at all.</p>

    <p>The critique is not entirely unfair: it makes the point that the model and
        the response of governments didn’t account for some people voluntarily taking
        action to reduce their risk of infection.</p>

    <p>But much of the Imperial College model did in fact stand up to scrutiny in
        the long run. There have been over 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths in the US. At
        least <a
                  href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/dec/us-covid-19-vaccination-program-one-year-how-many-deaths-and">one
        study</a> estimated that vaccines saved over a million lives were saved by
        vaccination. This suggests that Covid in the US, left unchecked, may well have
        claimed about 2 million lives. But the Imperial College model did not get the
        timeframe or wavy nature of the pandemic right.</p>

    <p>Even so, this is not the point. The modellers didn’t emphasise their precise
        measurements. That wasn’t the point of their model. Their aim was rather to
        reach broad conclusions: that if the pandemic was left unmitigated or
        unsuppressed it would have a much more devastating impact. On this they were
        right.</p>

    <p>In South Africa the earliest released <a
                                                 href="https://www.groundup.org.za/article/heres-what-models-predict-about-covid-19/">government
        model</a> was widely criticised by opponents of lockdowns, who wanted to
        minimise the pandemic’s effects to support their arguments. The model had, a
        quickly done back-of-a-cigarette-box, feel to it. Like the Imperial College
        model it didn’t account for mutations and the consequent wavy nature of the
        disease, and it also predicted a much swifter unfolding of things. But, frankly,
        given the state of knowledge at the time, a simple SIR-type model was arguably
        sufficient to make the point that reducing social contacts would slow the
        pandemic.</p>

    <p>The Imperial College model was one of several used to justify
        stringent anti-Covid measures by governments, the curtailments
        on freedom to facilitate social (or physical) distancing that
        came to be called lockdowns. The severity of lockdowns varied
        dramatically from country to country, time to time and even
        between cities in the same country. The debates on the pros and
        cons of lockdowns are complex. That some lockdowns saved lives
        is supported by the weight of evidence (## insert some
        citations).</p>

    <p>This doesn't mean there were not important arguments against
        lockdown to consider: the psychological and economic effects are
        still being endured today (and China continues to implement
        brutal lockdowns at the time of writing). But arguing against
        lockdowns by failing to acknowledge that at least some of them
        saved lives isn't tenable. One can of course, perhaps even
        reasonably, argue that there are other costs to society that
        outweigh the lives that were saved, though I have seldom seen
        this being said forthrightly.
    </p>

    <p>Given the heated ideological disputes in response to Covid,
        perhaps there was no way early modellers could have escaped
        criticism, even if they had miraculously estimated the
        trajectory of the pandemic with pinpoint accuracy. Nevertheless
        modellers might consider explicitly explaining upfront that it
        is the broad conclusions rather than the specific estimates of
        their model that are important.</p>

    <p>Also, when an epidemic’s parameters are hard to know with precision or vary a
        lot from place to place, modellers should perhaps consider running thousands of
        simulations that randomly perturb the parameters within reasonable ranges. Then
        we can present multiple possible scenarios to the public. Though this must be
        done in a way that emphasises the more likely scenarios and that does not
        overwhelm the public with a plethora of possibilities. Done properly, I hope
        this acknowledgement of our ignorance may actually gain greater public
        confidence in the modelling process.</p>
