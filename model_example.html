/*
 * Compilation instructions using gcc (tested on Linux using gcc version
 * 11.3):
 *
 * Debug version: g++ -Wall -g model_example.cc -o model_example
 *
 * Optimized version: g++ -Wall -O3 model_example.cc -o model_example
 *
 * If you are using clang, simply replace g++ with clang++.
 *
 * If you are using a slightly older gcc or clang compiler you might need to
 * use the -std=c++17 flag.
 *
 * This is an example of how to implement an agent-based or micro model.  I
 * have kept it simple but not too simple. It needs to be complicated enough
 * to show how a micro model can be much more flexible than a macro one, and
 * able to account for heterogeneous characteristics across a
 * population. For a more complicated model, see
 * https://github.com/nathangeffen/ABM_CTI/blob/master/abm_hetgen.cc.  This

/*
 * A few notes on style:
 *
 * I have tried to find a balance between keeping the code readable and
 * using C++'s newer very convenient features. I have tried to avoid using
 * constructors and destructors. I have used printf instead of cout because
 * the latter is often way too verbose. I have also used struct instead of
 * class because having to deal with private variables and getters and
 * setters is unnecessary for the pedagogical purposes of this
 * code. Moreover, in my experience, most models are implemented by one or
 * two people. The software engineering benefits of using private variables
 * (and several other C++ features) may be immense for large teams, but they
 * simply get in the way of small one/two/three people projects.
 *
 * There are a lot of features and improvements intentionally omitted.  The
 * aim of this code is to be an example that modellers can extend. Bells and
 * whistles that make the code more difficult to comprehend have therefore
 * been left out.
 *
 * Also, I am not an expert on C++. If there are some things I could do
 * better, without making the program more difficult to read, please let me
 * know.
