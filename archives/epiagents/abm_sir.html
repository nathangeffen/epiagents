        <h1>Some notes on infectious disease modelling</h1>
        <p>By Nathan Geffen, June to November 2022</p>

        <p>
            There are many ways to model epidemics, but we can broadly divide
            models into two types: macro and micro. Macro models are often also
            called compartmental or equation-based, while micro models are often
            called agent-based or individual-based simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the onset of the Covid pandemic, many websites explained how the
            simplest useful macro model, an SIR one (for
            Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered), worked. We start with that and
            then try to implement an equivalent micro model. We then discuss the
            differences between the two models and their consequences for
            understanding real-world epidemics. Then we implement models of HIV
            and Covid and consider what we can learn about these and other
            infectious diseases from macro and micro models.

            <h1>Terminology</h1>
            <p>
                Terminology is inconsistent across infectious disease
                literature. Macro, micro, compartmental, SIR, equation-based,
                deterministic, stochastic: all are used to describe types of
                models. I find the macro vs micro distinction the most useful
                here, in part because the terms are proper antonyms and using
                them in the source code makes it easier to read. Also while
                macro models are usually deterministic, they can be implemented
                stochastically. And I suppose micro models can be implemented
                deterministically, though a use-case of that doesn't spring to
                mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Macro and micro models are broad categories and there are all
                manner of models that borrow ideas from both.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the most part, I try to stick to terminology used in <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">An
                introduction to Infectious Disease Modelling</a> by Emilia Vynnycky and Richard
                G White.

        <h2>A very simple disease</h2>

        <p>
            We start off with a very simple infectious disease. It has the
            following characteristics:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>A substantial population, at least 100 people, starts off with a
            tiny number of infected people, maybe even just one person.</li>
            <li>People in this population randomly (homogenously) mix with each
            other.</li>
            <lI>While there are a tiny number of infected people in the
                population, they will on average infect two other people before they recover.</li>
            <li>Infected people on average take 5 days to recover.</li>
            <li>Once recovered, a person has immunity. They can't become
                infected again and they can't transmit the infection to anyone else.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note that no-one dies and there are no births or migration into or
        out of this population, at least for the duration that we will model
        this disease.</p>

        <p>
            Characteristic 3 of our model is what's commonly called
            $\underline{R}_0$ in epidemiological literature. The real-world use
            of $\underline{R}_0$ is much more limited than is usually admitted
            but it's still useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            We call our description above a model world. We can implement both a
            macro or a micro model version of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this population we have people who are <b>S</b>usceptible to the
            infection, but not yet infected. There are infected people, and all
            infected people also <b>I</b>nfectious. And we have <b>R</b>ecovered people.
            That's three compartments: Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered, abbreviated as SIR.
        </p>
        <p>
            We initialize our model so that nearly everyone in the population is
            uninfected and has never had the infection. In other words everyone
            is in the Susceptible compartment and a tiny number are in the
            Infectious compartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's assume the population size is 100. Then we'll set $S$, the
            number of people in the Susceptible compartment to 99 and $I$, the
            number of people in the Infectious compartment to 1. The number of
            people, $R$, in the Recovered compartment is 0. (Note we do not
            underline ${R}$, the number of recovered people, to differentiate it
            from $\underline{R}_0$, the number of people that each infectious
            person will infect when the epidemic is still very small. I wish
            this was a standard adopted throughout infectious disease
            literature.)
        </p>
        <p>
            All the above is common to both the macro and micro models that we
            implement. Now let's describe specific details of our macro model:
        </p>

        <h3>Macro Model: SIR</h3>

        <p>
            We iteratively update the $S$, $I$ and $R$ compartments with the
            number of people who have moved between them. In our model each
            iteration represents a day in our infectious disease world. These
            equations describe what happens on each iteration:
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the number of people in our macro model compartments are
            continuous real numbers, not discrete. This is a big difference
            between our macro and micro models.
        </p>

        <p>
            The number of people who become infected on each iteration, or day,
            of our model is a function of S, I and the risk of infection $\lambda$.
            Since all three of these variables change with time, we subscript them.
            This equation describes the flow from $S$ to $I$:

            \begin{equation}
            S_{t+1}=S_t - \lambda_t S_t
            \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            Since people mix homogenously, we have:

            \begin{equation} \lambda_t = \beta I_t \end{equation}

            where

            \begin{equation} \beta = {\underline{R} \over {ND}} \end{equation}

            where $N$ is the population size and $D$ is the average number of
            days a person is infected (5 in our model).
        </p>

        <p>
            The other equations in the model are simple:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            I_{t+1}=I_t + \lambda_t S_t - rI_t
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            R_{t+1}=R_t + rI_t
            \end{equation}

            where $r$ is the rate of recovery per day, or $1/5$ in our model.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can depict what happens on each time step (or day) graphically:

            <h1>History of the SIR model</h1>
            <p>
                Of course, infectious disease modelling didn't start with Covid. Its
                modern form can be traced back to the English cattle plague of 18XX.

            <h1 id="why-the-imperial-college-covid-model-was-useful">Did models help the response to Covid?</h1>

            <p>In March 2020 – a few months after the appearance of the Covid-19 pandemic –
                a <a
                      href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-16-COVID19-Report-9.pdf">micro
                model</a> by Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College</a> in the UK was
                widely reported in the media. The modellers considered how various
                interventions, such as isolation, quarantining, social distancing and school and
                university closures would affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the pressure on
                hospitals.</p>

            <p>Their report is detailed and nuanced. There is extensive discussion about
                mitigating the effects of Covid-19 — reducing <span class="math
                                                                           inline"><em>R</em></span> but not below 1 — versus suppressing it completely —
                reducing <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> below 1. It also had to
                make a plethora of assumptions given how little was understood about Covid-19 at
                the time.</p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, as with any model that tries to predict the future, the model
                got some things wrong, such as the time period over which Covid would peak. It
                also didn’t consider that SARS-CoV-2 would mutate and that the epidemic would
                return in waves of differing infectiousness and virulence.</p>

            <p>The report concludes that social distancing would have the largest impact.
                Combining this with isolating infected people and school and university closure
                had “the potential to suppress transmission below the threshold of <span
                                                                                       class="math inline"><em>R</em> = 1</span>”, the authors wrote.</p>

            <p>They also pointed out that, “to avoid a rebound in transmission”, these
                policies would need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine became
                available. They pessimistically predicted this would be 18 months or more, but
                in fact vaccines became available near the end of 2020, although most countries
                wouldn’t start rolling them out until 2021.</p>

            <p>The authors recommended using hospital surveillance to switch these measures
                on and off. Importantly they wrote: “Given local epidemics are not perfectly
                synchronised, local policies are also more efficient and can achieve comparable
                levels of suppression to national policies while being in force for a slightly
                smaller proportion of the time.”</p>

            <p>They were cautious:</p>

            <p>“However, there are very large uncertainties around the transmission of this
                virus, the likely effectiveness of different policies and the extent to which
                the population spontaneously adopts risk reducing behaviours. This means it is
                difficult to be definitive about the likely initial duration of measures which
                will be required, except that it will be several months. Future decisions on
                when and for how long to relax policies will need to be informed by ongoing
                surveillance.”</p>

            <p>They also considered mitigation instead of suppression:</p>

            <p>“Our results show that the alternative relatively short-term (3-month)
                mitigation policy option might reduce deaths seen in the epidemic by up to half,
                and peak healthcare demand by two-thirds. The combination of case isolation,
                household quarantine and social distancing of those at higher risk of severe
                outcomes (older individuals and those with other underlying health conditions)
                are the most effective policy combination for epidemic mitigation.”</p>

            <p>There is very little emphasis on actual results. The same is true for
                Imperial College’s <a
                                       href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/196234/covid-19-imperial-researchers-model-likely-impact/">news
                summary</a> of the report for the general public. This seems to be a sensible
                approach. No model in March 2020, less than three months after Covid-19 had been
                discovered, could rely on sufficient accurate knowledge to predict the future
                with any realistic accuracy. Even when diseases are well-understood, and slow
                moving, like TB and HIV, it is almost impossible to predict future infections
                and mortality with much accuracy.</p>

            <p>What models can do, and what the Imperial College model did, is show the
                approximate magnitude of certain interventions on mitigating or suppressing
                infectious outbreaks.</p>

            <p>Yet the Imperial College model was widely criticised, especially by those
                with an ideology opposed to stringent government intervention.</p>

            <p>In April 2020, the US-based Cato Institute <a
                                                              href="https://www.cato.org/blog/how-one-model-simulated-22-million-us-deaths-covid-19">lambasted</a>
                the model. It criticised its pessimistic predictions, which hadn’t come close to
                being true by that time. “Neither the high infection rate nor the high fatality
                rate holds up under scrutiny.” The article, which echoed the Cato Institute’s
                opposition to lockdowns or any stringent government measures to control the
                epidemic, stated:</p>

            <p>“The trouble with being too easily led by models is we can too easily be
                misled by models. Epidemic models may seem entirely different from economic
                models or climate models, but they all make terrible forecasts if filled with
                wrong assumptions and parameters.”</p>

            <p>Much is made of the model’s estimate of 2.2 million Covid-19 deaths in the US
                in the absence of any interventions, something the modelling report correctly
                did <strong>not</strong> emphasise at all.</p>

            <p>The critique is not entirely unfair: it makes the point that the model and
                the response of governments didn’t account for some people voluntarily taking
                action to reduce their risk of infection.</p>

            <p>But much of the Imperial College model did in fact stand up to scrutiny in
                the long run. There have been over 1.1 million Covid-19 deaths in the US. At
                least <a
                          href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2021/dec/us-covid-19-vaccination-program-one-year-how-many-deaths-and">one
                study</a> estimated that vaccines saved over a million lives were saved by
                vaccination. This suggests that Covid in the US, left unchecked, may well have
                claimed about 2 million lives. But the Imperial College model did not get the
                timeframe or wavy nature of the pandemic right.</p>

            <p>Even so, this is not the point. The modellers didn’t emphasise their precise
                measurements. That wasn’t the point of their model. Their aim was rather to
                reach broad conclusions: that if the pandemic was left unmitigated or
                unsuppressed it would have a much more devastating impact. On this they were
                right.</p>

            <p>In South Africa the earliest released <a
                                                         href="https://www.groundup.org.za/article/heres-what-models-predict-about-covid-19/">government
                model</a> was widely criticised by opponents of lockdowns, who wanted to
                minimise the pandemic’s effects to support their arguments. The model had, a
                quickly done back-of-a-cigarette-box, feel to it. Like the Imperial College
                model it didn’t account for mutations and the consequent wavy nature of the
                disease, and it also predicted a much swifter unfolding of things. But, frankly,
                given the state of knowledge at the time, a simple SIR-type model was arguably
                sufficient to make the point that reducing social contacts would slow the
                pandemic.</p>

            <p>The Imperial College model was one of several used to justify
                stringent anti-Covid measures by governments, the curtailments
                on freedom to facilitate social (or physical) distancing that
                came to be called lockdowns. The severity of lockdowns varied
                dramatically from country to country, time to time and even
                between cities in the same country. The debates on the pros and
                cons of lockdowns are complex. That some lockdowns saved lives
                is supported by the weight of evidence (## insert some
                citations).</p>

            <p>This doesn't mean there were not important arguments against
                lockdown to consider: the psychological and economic effects are
                still being endured today (and China continues to implement
                brutal lockdowns at the time of writing). But arguing against
                lockdowns by failing to acknowledge that at least some of them
                saved lives isn't tenable. One can of course, perhaps even
                reasonably, argue that there are other costs to society that
                outweigh the lives that were saved, though I have seldom seen
                this being said forthrightly.

            <p>Given the heated ideological disputes in response to Covid,
                perhaps there was no way early modellers could have escaped
                criticism, even if they had miraculously estimated the
                trajectory of the pandemic with pinpoint accuracy. Nevertheless
                modellers might consider explicitly explaining upfront that it
                is the broad conclusions rather than the specific estimates of
                their model that are important.</p>

            <p>Also, when an epidemic’s parameters are hard to know with precision or vary a
                lot from place to place, modellers should perhaps consider running thousands of
                simulations that randomly perturb the parameters within reasonable ranges. Then
                we can present multiple possible scenarios to the public. Though this must be
                done in a way that emphasises the more likely scenarios and that does not
                overwhelm the public with a plethora of possibilities. Done properly, I hope
                this acknowledgement of our ignorance may actually gain greater public
                confidence in the modelling process.</p>
