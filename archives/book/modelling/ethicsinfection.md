# A Covid dinner party

A group of people in Cape Town go to a family Christmas dinner. At the time the
Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant was spreading rapidly through the city. Several of
the dinner attendees subsequently test positive. There were 20 people at the
dinner but we shall only consider the actions of some of them.

Novak is unvaccinated and rather outspoken about his anti-vaccination views.
Unbeknown to him, he arrived at the party already infected. He is in his 30s and
has no known comorbidities. He was the only unvaccinated adult at the party.

Lisa is vaccinated but also unbeknown to her she arrives at the party already
infected. She is in her 30s and has no known comorbidities.

Novak and Lisa are the only two people who arrive at the dinner already
infected. One or both of them infect several other family members, but we never
find out who was responsible for which infections.

Mabel is the grandmother and patriarch of the family. She is vaccinated but a
few days after the dinner she tests positive. She is elderly, frail, and has
hypertension. She is at serious risk of dying from Covid.

Tim is unvaccinated. While he is sceptical of vaccines, he is not outspoken
about his views and feels out of his depth on the issue. He is not knowledgeable
about medicine but at least recognises this. He tests positive a few days after
the dinner. He is in his 30s.

Mary is vaccinated. She is in her 30s and tests positive a few days after the
dinner. Then so do her young children who were not at the dinner --- they were
being looked after by Nomfundo the nanny who is in her 50s and has diabetes. A
few days after the children test positive, Nomfundo also tests positive.

Barbara is the dinner party host. She is vaccinated. She didn't contract
SARS-CoV-2.

Keith is Mary's husband. He refused to attend the Christmas dinner and pleaded
with Mary not to attend. Furious, he moved into a hotel on Christmas night. He
is even angrier after Mary sero-converted and their relationship is now in
trouble.

A half-dozen other family members attended the dinner but they neither
contracted nor transmitted SARS-CoV-2, and ethical concerns about their
behaviour are represented by the other characters so we'll ignore them.

Who, if anyone, has acted unethically in the above (fictitious) scenario? What,
if any, consequences should there be legally, for medical care - if required,
and for our sympathy?

With ethical questions it's usually important to understand our ethical system.
For example, are we arguing from a utilitarian or social contract perspective? I
am unconvinced this is important here, so long as one favours a system that
broadly acknowledge equality between humans, whatever that might mean. If one
favours the maxim that one should treat others as yourself, that is sufficient
for being able to read this essay with similar enough assumptions to the author.

Instead I want to argue that the best way to approach this is from the
perspective of analysing risk. Nearly every choice we make carries risk,
admittedly usually negligible, to ourselves and others. When we drive a car we
risk killing our passengers, people in other vehicles, and pedestrians. Walking
across a road carries a small chance of death, both to us and others.

Some choices carry considerable risks. Keith and Mary often go rock-climbing, a
sport with high risk of injury, and not a trivial risk of death. Novak plays
tennis and three years ago his doubles partner dropped dead from a heart attack
while playing. (Some say this is why he's become such a douche.)

Even mundane tasks like cooking a dinner for friends carries risk of food
poisoning. I have not forgotten the Rosh Hashanah dinner I had with at my aunt's
place as a kid in which all of us got violently ill. The chopped liver was the
likely culprit.

The point is that it's impossible to proceed through life without taking risks,
however small, that may lead to injury or death to oneself or others.

Some risks are patently reckless. Jumping out of a Cessna at $3000$ metres
without a parachute and hoping to survive uninjured is an extreme example to
make the point. And forcing someone out the aircraft with you is manslaughter
even if your intention is not to kill them. At a lesser extreme walking across a
road without looking left or right or talking on a cell phone while driving are
examples of high-risk choices that most people, including myself, have made.

One can also choose to be highly risk averse - hardly ever going out except for
essential activities, hardly ever participating in pastimes with significant
risk. But paradoxically perhaps such a life comes with an elevated risk of poor
mental health. As Jack London [reportedly told a journalist][NPR] shortly before he
died at the age of 40 after a life of adventure and hard drinking , "I would
rather be ashes than dust ... The function of man is to live, not to exist." (A
variation of this appears in the latest James Bond movie.)

Humans, like most mammals, have evolved to be able to assess risk. Often not
well, and frequently using incomplete and imperfect knowledge. Nevertheless we
are constantly assessing whether an action is worth taking. We have differing
aptitudes for calculating risk and differing desires for how much risk we're
willing to take. Many even enjoy high-risk experiences. Reasonable people will
disagree on whether a risk is worth taking, but there are risks that all
reasonable people will agree are negligible (e.g. crossing the road) or not
worth it (e.g. intentionally infecting oneself with Ebola).

Assessing the risk of a particular event with respect to Covid infection differs
across people. Mabel knew there was a big risk she may become ill, even die. But
she weighed this up with the facts that she had not seen her family together for
over a year. These family affairs mean more to her than almost anything else at
this stage of her life, and she was unsure how many such events lay ahead.

Mary and Barbara had were ambivalent about attending the dinner, but for them
the joy it would bring their grandmother ultimately outweighed their concern
about Covid.

Novak and Lisa, who have since tested positive and realised Mabel may be dying
in ICU because of them feel terribly guilty. But while Lisa will talk of her
troubled conscience, Novak will hide it with bluster.

# Lockdown laws


# Claims to health care

In the 2000s David Benatar published an article in The Lancet arguing that

# What about Novak?

Differentiate between quiet concern vs loud ideological

Children as unavoidable vectors of infectious disease, and parents investing
their greatest effort in them.

# Notes

- variables effecting risk: life expectancy, values of society eg beliefs in honour and afterlife. A frail 80 year old may value a dinner with family over the risk of Covid. A young man in 9th century Scandinavia will willingly take the risk of death of a voyage to England compared the tough humdrum domestic life. Same with European migrants from the 15th through 19th centuries and African migrants across the Mediterranean now, who surely know there is a high risk of drowning. Even upper middle class pilgrims to Everest each year.
- the Christmas dinner participants were not breaking the law. Why were the restrictions introduced? To try to  flatten the curve and prepare health systems. Within those restrictions, people must be left to make their own risk assessments. Other than patently reckless behaviour for no good reason, I can't see an ethical problem. Attending a family gathering has great psychological benefit for many of the participants; it shouldn't be dismissed as a trivial reason to risk Covid.
- On lockdown rules: ethically one should adhere to them if one accepts that they will reduce the force of the pandemic.
- we assess risk of death differently now from 100 years ago even. Examine death rate in UK before 1914 versus 2020.
- And risk across the world differs. Lower life expectancy and economic hardships in poor country may outweigh lockdown benefits compared to wealthy country. This has been a critique of South Africa.
- general Adherence to lockdown rules also makes a difference perhaps. By  2021 lockdown adherence in SA  had all but completely collapsed but this is an area of state overreach, competence and politics rather than individual ethics.
