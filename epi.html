            In late 1865 cows began dying in large numbers in England. This
            cattle plague was probably caused by the Rinderpest virus. Beef had
            become a vital part of the economy and so there was concern at the
            highest level of government. A commission was set up to investigate
            the epidemic. In February 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lowe">Robert Lowe</a>,
            a Member of Parliament on this commission, made a gloomy prediction</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If we do not get the disease under by the middle of April, prepare
            yourself for a calamity beyond all calculation. You have seen the
            thing in its infancy. Wait and you will see the averages, which have
            been thousands, grow to tens of thousands, for there is no reason
            why the same terrible law of increase which has prevailed hitherto
            should not prevail henceforth.
            (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25314501">Brownlee,
            BMJ, 14 Aug 1915, p. 251</a>)

            William Farr was an epidemiologist who had in 1840 shown that the
            distribution of smallpox deaths were approximated by a normal curve.
            He wrote a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25314501">letter</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_News_(UK)">Daily News</a>,
            a newspaper started 20 years earlier by Charles Dickens, explaining
            why things were not quite as awful as Lowe thought. He presented the
            recorded number of cases since the epidemic started:

            There are many ways to model epidemics, but we can broadly divide
            models into two types: macro and micro. The former typically use a
            set of equations &mdash; either difference or differential ones
            &mdash; to calculate changes in a population, while the latter
            consist of numerous agents, each representing a person with their
            own specific behaviour. Macro models are often also called
            compartmental or equation-based, while micro models are often called
            agent-based or individual-based simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the onset of the Covid pandemic, many websites explained how the
            simplest useful macro model, an SIR one (for
            Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered), worked. We'll start with that and
            then try to implement an equivalent micro model. We'll then discuss
            the differences between the two types of models and their
            consequences for understanding real-world epidemics. Then we'll
            implement models of HIV and Covid and consider what we can learn
            about these and other infectious diseases from macro and micro
            models.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Terminology is inconsistent across infectious disease
                    literature. For example, Macro, micro, compartmental, SIR,
                    equation-based, deterministic, stochastic: all are used to
                    describe types of models. I find the macro vs micro
                    distinction the most useful here, in part because the terms
                    are antonyms and using them in the source code makes
                    it easier to read. Also while macro models are usually
                    deterministic, they can be implemented stochastically. Micro
                    models can also be implemented deterministically, though a
                    use-case doesn't spring to mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Macro and micro models are broad categories and there are
                    all manner of models that borrow ideas from both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most part, I try to stick to terminology used in <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">An
                    introduction to Infectious Disease Modelling</a> by Emilia
                    Vynnycky and Richard G White. This is my reference book for

        <h2>A very simple disease</h2>

        <p>
            We start off with a very simple infectious disease. It has the
            following characteristics:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                A population of at 1,000 people starts off with one infected
                person.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every person in the population is equally likely to be in
                contact with any one else in the population. We call this
                homogenous mixing. (Changing to heterogeneous mixing makes
                things much more complicated.)
            </li>
            <lI>When there are a tiny number of infected people in the
                population, they will on average infect two other people before
                they recover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Infected people on average take 5 days to recover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once recovered, a person has immunity. They can't become
                infected again and they can't transmit the infection to anyone
                else.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            No-one dies and there are no births or migration into or out of this
            population, at least for the time period that we model.
        </p>

        <p>
            Characteristic 3 of our model is what's commonly called
            $\underline{R}_0$, or the <em>basic reproduction number</em> in
            epidemiological literature. <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">Vynnycky and
            White</a> write: "$\underline{R}_0$ is defined as the average number
            of secondary infectious persons resulting from a typical infectious
            person following their introduction into a totally susceptible
            population".
        </p>

        <p>The real-world use of $\underline{R}_0$ is much more limited than is
            usually admitted but it's still useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            We call our description above a model world. We can implement both a
            macro or a micro model version of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this population we have people who are <b>S</b>usceptible to the
            infection, but not yet infected. There are infected people, and all
            infected people are also <b>I</b>nfectious. We also have <b>R</b>ecovered people.
            That's three compartments: Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered, abbreviated as SIR.
        </p>
        <p>
            We initialize our model so that nearly everyone in the population is
            uninfected and has never had the infection. In other words everyone
            is in the Susceptible compartment and a tiny number are in the
            Infectious compartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's assume the population size is 1000. Then we'll set $S$, the
            number of people in the Susceptible compartment to 999 and $I$, the
            number of people in the Infectious compartment to 1. The number of
            people, $R$, in the Recovered compartment is 0. (Note we do not
            underline ${R}$, the number of recovered people, to differentiate it
            from $\underline{R}_0$, the number of people that each infectious
            person will infect when the epidemic is still very small. I wish
            this was a standard adopted throughout infectious disease
            literature.)
        </p>

        <p>
            All the above is common to both the macro and micro models that we
            implement. Now let's describe specific details of our macro model:
        </p>

        <h3>SIR Macro model using difference equations</h3>

        <p>
            We iteratively update the $S$, $I$ and $R$ compartments with the
            number of people who have moved between them. In our model each
            iteration represents a day in our infectious disease world. These
            equations describe what happens on each iteration:
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the number of people in our macro model compartments are
            continuous real numbers, not discrete. This is a big difference
            between our macro and micro models.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider two scenarios: (1) There are very few infected people in a
            population &mdash; nearly everyone is susceptible &mdash; versus (2)
            nearly everyone is infected &mdash; there are few susceptible
            people. In the former scenario, the infected people are much more
            likely to come into contact with susceptible people, infecting some
            of them. In the latter, since there are few susceptible people, the
            average infected person is less likely to come into contact with
            them.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's quite straightforward to capture this as an equation. The number
            of people who become infected on each iteration, or day, of our
            model is a function of S, I and the risk of infection $\lambda$.
            Since all three of these variables change with time, we subscript
            them. This equation describes the flow from $S$ to $I$:

            \begin{equation} S_{t+1}=S_t - \lambda_t S_t \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            So if 10 people are susceptible and 2 of them become infected on an
            iteration, $\lambda$ on that particular iteration is 0.2. But how do we update $\lambda$ on each iteration?
        </p>

        <p>
            Since people mix homogenously, we have:

            \begin{equation} \lambda_t = \beta I_t \end{equation}

            where

            \begin{equation} \beta = {\underline{R}_0 \over {ND}} \end{equation}

            where $N$ is the population size and $D$ is the average number of
            days a person is infected (5 in our model).
        </p>

        <p>
            The other equations in the model are simple:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            I_{t+1}=I_t + \lambda_t S_t - rI_t
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            R_{t+1}=R_t + rI_t
            \end{equation}

            where $r$ is the rate of recovery per day, or $1/5$ in our model.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is an implementation of this model:
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="sir.svg" alt="Basic SIR graph">
        </p>


        <div id="macroSIR" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            There are four boxes shown in each model:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Outputs</dt>
            <dd>
                This shows the population size of each compartment after each
                iteration of a model.
            </dd>

            <dt>Parameters</dt>
            <dd>
                You can change the parameters before running a model. Press the <em>Reset</em> button
                to set the parameters to their original values. So for example, try increasing or
            </dd>

            <dt>Graph</dt>
            <dd>This shows how the compartment population sizes change over
                time.</dd>

            <dt>Population</dt>
            <dd>This shows the status of the individuals in the population. This
                makes much more sense for micro models. In macro models you usually
                have fractions of individuals, so we round off. Also our macro
                models are deterministics so all the individuals in a particular
                compartment are grouped together. </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Adjust the speed slider to make the model run faster or slower.
        </p>

        <p>Click the <em>Run</em> button to run a model. It changes to a <em>Stop</em> button
            while the model is running so that you can interrupt the model. This
            is useful if it's taking too long.</p>


        <h3>Using differential equations</h3>

        <p>
            Modelling using difference equations is often adequate. But there is
            a problem. Let's change our model world so that our disease is
            highly infectious. Let's set $\underline{R}_0$ to 20. Now run the
            model. It goes horribly wrong. By day 5 the number of susceptible
            agents is negative, an impossible situation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason this has happened is because infections are happening so
            quickly that our timestep of 1 day is now too large. By day 5
            $\lambda$ becomes greater than 1, resulting in more infections
            occurring than the size of the suceptible population, which is
            absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to fix such a problem. One would be to have each
            iteration represent a much smaller time unit. You'd have to change
            the value of $D$ appropriately. So if your timestep is 1/10th of a
            day, then $D$ is then set to 50 to represent our new model world.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative is to instead use differential equations. Difference
            equations calculate changes to compartments across discrete time
            steps, while a differential equation is continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Differential equations express the what the rates of change in
            compartments converge to as the time steps becomes tinier and
            tinier, getting closer and closer to zero. (A rudimentary calculus
            book can explain this better and in more depth. Also, the
            explanation in
            <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">Vynnycky and
                White</a> is excellent.) Instead of using the subscript $t$
            in our notation, our equations are now functions of time.
        </p>

        <p>Recasting our difference equations as differential equations, we have:</p>

        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta I(t) S(t)
            \end{equation}


            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I(t) S(t) - r I(t)
            \end{equation}

            and

            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dR}{dt} =  r I(t)
            \end{equation}

        </p>

        <p>Here is an implementation of the model using differential equations.</p>

        <div id="macroSIROde" class="sir"></div>

        <p>If you run this as is, you end up with almost the same epidemic as
            with our difference equations. The differential equation model model
            converges on just under 80% of the population getting infected,
            while the difference equation version converged on just over 80%
            getting infected. If you were modelling a real world epidemic, it's
            unlikely you'd be bothered by this difference in results because the
            margins of error in the data and parameters are far greater than
            this.
        </p>
        <p>But setting $\underline{R}_0$ to 20, now obtains sensible results.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, even here there are limitations. Our differential
            equations are being solved using discrete computer hardware and must
            approximate solutions of continuous functions. The simple algorithm
            we use to solve our differential equations also breaks down if we
            set $\underline{R}_0$ to close to 3000 without reducing the time
            step. Of course such a high $\underline{R}_0$ is of no practical
            concern.

        <h3>SIR micro model</h3>

        <p>Now let's implement a micro model that approximates the above macro
        model.</p>

        <p>
            A micro model consists of agents and events. An agent typically
            represents a single person in a population. An event typically is
            executed on a subset of agents. There are different ways to implement
            micro models. The methodology described here is simple and fast.
        </p>

        <p> There are three stages to executing our micro models: <em>before</em>
            events, <em>during</em> events and <em>after</em> events.
        </p>
        <p>
            First execute the
            <em>before</em> events. These typically would create and initialise
            the agents, write a report of the initial state of the population
            and perhaps calculate some working variables that won't change once
            the simulation starts. </p>
        <p>
            Then iteratively execute the <em>during</em> events until some stop
            condition is met. As with our difference equation macro model, each
            iteration corresponds to our time step. A simple stop condition is
            simply to execute the during events $n$ times, where $n$ is a
            user-defined constant. Typical during events would shuffle the
            agents (to generate more stochasticity), infect some susceptibe
            agents, vaccinate some agents, recover some infected agents, or kill
            some ill agents.</p>
        <p>
            Finally execute the after events which would typically be writing a
            report or creating a CSV file of the outputs.
        </p>

        <p>Here is the structure of our micro models:</p>

        <pre>
Execute before events
# Simulation loop:
Loop n times:
   for each during event, e:
       For each agent, a:
           If e should be applied to a:
              e(a)
Execute after events
        </pre>

        <p>Here is a micro model for our simple model world.</p>

        <div id="microSIR" class="sir"></div>

        <p>Run the two SIR macro models and then run the micro model multiple
        times. What do you notice?</p>

        <p>
            Even with these simple models of our highly idealised model world,
            there are already interesting observations we can make:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The macro models obviously gives the same outputs every time.
                They're entirely deterministic. The micro model seldom repeats
                exactly the same outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the parameters used here, the infectious disease in the
                micro model often fails to take off; no one besides the
                originally infected agent becomes infected.
            </li>
            <li>
                The macro models end with about 80% of people in the
                recovery compartment. The micro model epidemic on average has
                far fewer infections. This is because with just one initial
                infection it often fails to "take off".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I ran the micro model 100 times. In some simulations, there are no
            new infections. The most number of infections in a simulation was
            856 infections, higher than the macro models. But the mean number of
            total infections across the simulations was only about 47%, much
            lower than the macro models. One thing of real-world consequence
            that this suggests is when an infected person enters a community of
            otherwise entirely uninfected people, there is a great deal of
            chance as to whether an epidemic will occur in that community.
        </p>

        <p>
            During Covid, there were many reports comparing why many people
            became infected in one geographic location versus another. Such
            speculation can be useful. The severity of an epidemic can be
            mitigated by timely rational action. But we should realise the role
            of chance; sometimes whether an epidemic explodes in one community
            and dissipates without much consequence in another is a matter of
            nature playing dice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are the difference equation SIR macro model (difference
            equations) and the SIR micro model again but with one difference:
            the number of infections in the initial population is 100 instead of
            1.

                <p>
                    You could press the Run button on a micro model 100 times
                    and tabulate the outputs each time, but there's a much
                    easier way.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then execute this code:
                        <pre>
series = EpiMicro.runSimulations(microSIR100, 100);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.min);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.max);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.mean);
                        </pre>
                        The first line runs the microSIR100 model 100 times. The
                        next three lines get the min, max and mean of the final
                        value of the recoveries in the model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To change the initial values of the model's
                        compartments, you can do something like this:
                        <pre>
// Change the number of initial susceptible agents to 990
microSIR100.compartments.S = 990;
// Change the number of initial infected agents to 10
microSIR100.compartments.I = 10;
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To change the model's parameters, you can first view them like so:
                        <pre>
microSIR.parameters;
                        </pre>
                        And then modify them as appropriate.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You can do the above with any of the models. All the model
                    names and their descriptions are stored in the
                    EpiUI.modelRegister variable. Obviously the macro models
                    give the same min, max and mean every time you run them.
                </p>
            </div>
        </aside>

        <p>
            Now running the micro model 100 times yields a mean of 843
            infections per simulation &mdash; you may get a slightly different
            answer each time you run it &mdash; about the same as the macro
            model's 842. The minimum number of infections in these 100
            simulations was 767 and the maximum was 892. Again, your outputs
            will likely differ a little.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tinker with the other parameters, $\underline{R}_0$ and $D$, to see
            how changing these changes the models' outputs.

                <h2>Matching the difference equation macro models</h2>
                <p>
                    I've tried to implement the micro models to match as closely
                    as possible the macro models that use difference equations.
                    The code makes certain compromises to do this. For example,
                    the $\lambda_t$ is calculated using the number of infections
                    at the end of the previous time step, not the current number
                    of infections which may have changed as the infection event
                    iterates over agents. Other than for the purpose of trying
                    to match the models as closely as possible, I see no reason
                    to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>What programming language to use for micro models?</h2>
                <p>
                    There is far more debate on the Internet about which are the
                    best programming languages than the topic deserves. In fact,
                    there are many good programming languages and all of them
                    are flawed. Write your first simulations in a programming
                    language you feel comfortable with. If it's a prototype it
                    doesn't matter if it's Python, R, Ruby, Basic or whatever
                    your favourite algebra for expressing algorithms is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need your simulation to execute many thousands of
                    times and you are finding it too slow, changing to a
                    compiled language like C, C++, Go, Fortran, Rust, Java or
                    even a lisp-type language, may be necessary. But often the
                    cause of execution being too slow isn't the language but an
                    algorithm you might be using. Perhaps consider optimising or
                    improving an algorithm before going to the effort of
                    learning a new programming language.
                </p>
                <p>For what it's worth I tend to implement my micro models in
                    Python when I'm just prototyping and then C or C++ if I
                    truly need a lot more speed. But the models on this webpage
                    are of course all implemented in Javascript, because that is
                    the main programming language that the most popular web
                    browsers support.

        <h3>Adding an exposure compartment</h3>

        <p>
            Let's get a bit more complicated. We change our model world so that
            there's an exposure compartment before an infectious one. When
            exposed a person is infected, but not infectious. In our model world
            the average exposure period is two days. This is an SEIR model.

        <h2>Measles</h2>

        <p>Measles is an interesting but frustrating infectious disease to
        model.</p>

        <p>
            This graph shows the oscillating nature of measles in England and
            Wales from 1950 to 1979. It is copied from
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7085179/">Fine and Clarkson, 1982</a> (<a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7085179/">full paper on Sci-hub</a>).
            Note how the epidemic returns approximately every two years. The
            arrow shows when the national measles vaccination programme was
            introduced, resulting in much smaller epidemics in subsequent years.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="MeaslesEnglandAndWales.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            As Fine and Clarkson explained, there were two theories to try and
            explain this. One was that the measles virus mutated over time, with
            a consequent decline in immunity and resurrection of the epidemic.
            The other, now more accepted theory &mdash; but not without
            controversy because the data doesn't fit either theory as well as
            epidemiologists would like &mdash; is that never-before infected
            children entering schools provide a new susceptible population for
            the epidemic to spike. In between spikes, there are still measles
            cases, but in such low numbers that they largely go undetected.
        </p>

        <p>Fine and Clarkson presented a set of difference equations, very
            similar to the SIR model. (Brian Williams has published useful <a href="http://www.ici3d.org/DAIDD2016/Materials/Brian%20Williams%20What%20is%20Science.pdf">slides</a>
            explaining various models, including this model.) I've implemented
            a model only superficially different to theirs.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are just three compartments: S, I and R. The infectious period
            is about 7 days. But this differs from the SIR model in that we
            increment S by the population growth rate, $\beta$ multipled by the
            population size, $N$. To keep our population size stable and to take
            into account that school children mainly mix with each other, we
            reduce the number in the R compartment by the same amount. (We set
            the population growth rate to approximately 2.5% per year.)
        </p>

        <p>Here are the difference equations:

            \begin{equation}
            I_{t+1} = \underline{R}_0 I_t {S_t \over N}
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            S_{t+1} = S_t - I_{t+1} + \beta N
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            R_t = R_t + I_t - \beta N
            \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a simple model but it's also unstable. Set $\underline{R}_0$
            a bit high and either $S$ or $R$ goes below zero and the model falls
            apart. So I've sligthly adapted the code for the above equations to
            not reduce $S$ or $R$ below zero. This keeps the model stable.
        </p>

        <div id="macroMeasles" class="sir"></div>

        <p>Notice the oscillations in measles cases every two or so years
            generated by the model. Adjust the value of $\beta$ and rerun the
            model to see how the oscillation period changes, &mdash; the 0.00095
            default is approximately 2% per annum adjusted to our two week time
            step. (It may be easier to view this graph by clicking on S and R in
            the graph legend, thus switching them off.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that $\beta$ determines the osccilation period while
            $\underline{R}_0$ determines the peak number of infections.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the face of it, this appears to capture the dynamics of measles
            epidemics. But here is a nearly equivalent micro model version.
        </p>

        <div id="microMeasles" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            Notice how the epidemic disappears. This is because in the macro
            model, which uses continuous variables, the number of infections
            never quite gets to zero, so equation 17 is always a positive
            number, albeit often a very tiny one. This means the epidemic will
            eventually resurrect in the macro model. But infection in the micro
            model is an all or nothing discrete affair. An agent is either
            infected or not. Quite quickly, the number of infections declines to
            exactly zero, and the epidemic cannot resurrect itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've addressed this by creating a parameter, $r$,
        </p>

            Modelling when to start HIV treatment
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the late 2000s there was a feisty discussion about when people
            with HIV should optimally start antiretroviral treatment.
            Antiretroviral pills taken daily for life reduce the number of HIV
            virions in the blood of infected people, usually to undetectable
            levels. This brings two advantages: (1) it extends life-expectancy
            to almost normal and (2) it reduces the risk of transmitting the
            virus to others, though this was not known with much confidence
            until a large clinical trial confirmed it in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideal time to start treatment wasn't clear because of three
            concerns: (1) the side effects of the drugs, (2) if drug resistance
            developed quickly a person would lose the benefit of the drug
            regimen, so starting later might extend the period of drug
            efficacy longer, and (3) the cost of the drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the mid 20-teens large well-conducted clinical trials had shown
            the benefit of starting treatment as soon as a person was diagnosed
            were substantial. Moreover drug resistance and serious side effects
            with newer antiretroviral regimens have become minor problems.
        </p>

        <p> Nevertheless in the late 2000s all of this was unclear. World Health
            Organisation researchers (Granich et al. 2009) published models in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673608616979">The Lancet</a> that
            showed that a policy of actively testing and immediately treating
            people with HIV in South Africa, the state with the most number of
            people with this virus in the world, would reduce the country's HIV
            prevalence to a negligible level in 50 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The paper certainly made a splash, evoking voiceferous discussion.
            According to Google Scholar it has been cited over 2,300 times. I
            suspect that until the Covid-19 pandemic it was the most highly
            cited infectious disease model ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            The graphic with its accompanying caption below, copied from the
            Granich paper in The Lancet, describes one of their models.

        <p>
            This is a much more complex model than our SEIR or measles ones. It
            accounts for population growth and deaths. The model specification
            has 10 compartments and another 10 parameters. Here is a macro model
            (using difference equations) implementation of Granich et al.
        </p>

        <div id="macroGranichEtAl" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            In the results table, the total number of infections (the sum of
            compartments I1 through I4 and A1 through A4) is tracked in the
            column with the heading I. Try adjusting the parameters and
            rerunning the model to see how the course of the epidemic changes,
            particularly the S (susceptibles), D (deaths) and I (infections) columns.
        </p>

        <p>We can quite easily implement a microsimulation version of this.</p>

        <p>
            While I have done my best to match the two models, the course of the
            epidemic is now highly non-linear and near-perfect matching like in
            the SIR and SEIR models doesn't seem possible. Nevertheless, in
            infectious disease modelling we are seldom, if ever, interested in
            precise predictions; we merely hope for plausible approximations. So
            the differences between the outputs of the two models appear to be
            inconsequential.
