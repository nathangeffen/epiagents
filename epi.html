        <h2>Cows and the origins of epidemiological modelling</h2>
        <p>
            In late 1865 cows began dying in large numbers in England. This
            cattle plague was probably caused by the Rinderpest virus. Beef had
            become a vital part of the economy and so there was concern at the
            highest level of government. A commission was set up to investigate
            the epidemic. In February 1866, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lowe">Robert Lowe</a>,
            a Member of Parliament on this commission, made a gloomy prediction</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            If we do not get the disease under by the middle of April, prepare
            yourself for a calamity beyond all calculation. You have seen the
            thing in its infancy. Wait and you will see the averages, which have
            been thousands, grow to tens of thousands, for there is no reason
            why the same terrible law of increase which has prevailed hitherto
            should not prevail henceforth.
            (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25314501">Brownlee,
            BMJ, 14 Aug 1915, p. 251</a>)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            William Farr was an epidemiologist who had in 1840 shown that the
            distribution of smallpox deaths were approximated by a normal curve.
            Actually the term "normal" wasn't part of statistical terminology
            until <a href="https://condor.depaul.edu/ntiourir/NormalOrigin.htm">
            several decades later</a>. Farr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farr%27s_laws">wrote</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "The rates vary with the density of the population, the numbers
            susceptible of attack, the mortality, and the accidental
            circumstances; so that to obtain the mean rates applicable to the
            whole population, or to any portion of the population, several
            epidemics should be investigated. It appears probable, however, that
            the smallpox increases at an accelerated and then a retarded rate;
            that it declines first at a slightly accelerated, and at a rapidly
            accelerated, and lastly at a retarded rate, until the disease
            attains the minimum intensity, and remains stationary."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            That's indeed a description of what we today call a normal curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1866, responding to the cattle epidemic, Farr wrote a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25314501">letter</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_News_(UK)">Daily News</a>,
            a newspaper started 20 years earlier by Charles Dickens. He
            explained why things were not quite as awful as Lowe thought. He
            presented the recorded number of new cases for every four weeks
            since the epidemic started:

            What Farr noticed is that although the number of new cases was
            rising alarmingly, the rate at which they were increasing was
            dropping rapidly: 96% increase from 4 November 1865 to 2 December,
            80% from 2 December to 30 December and only 39% from 30 December to
            27 January 1866. Farr used this to estimate new cases in the
            coming months. The following table gives Farr's predictions alongside
            the actual recorded cases. As Brownlee points out the epidemic ended
            about two weeks later than Farr predicted. But this is nevertheless
            an impressively close match.

        <div class="epi-table">
        <table>
            <caption>
                Farr explained his method: "To obtain the series, multiply the
                first number (9,597) by 1.9607, the product by 1.7981, and the
                second product by 1.3947. It will be observed that these rates
                decrease ; the second is obtained from the first by multiplying
                by .9171, and the third from the second by multiplying by .7757.
                Again, .7757 is obtained by multiplying .9171 by .8458. The
                progress is simplified by employing logarithms, and the series
                is continued by taking log. .9597, which equals 3.9821355; and
                the three orders of differences of the logarithms of the numbers
                derived from direct observation." <br/>

        <p>
            Farr explained the mechanism at work here. I've edited his words
            into more modern English: "All germs are reproduced in every
            individual they attack. If they lose part of the force of infection
            in every body through which they pass, the epidemic has a tendency
            to subside. Also, the individuals left are less susceptible of
            attack, either by constitution or by hygienic conditions, than those
            killed. This is as true of infections in animals as it is of
            epidemics attacking people." (Adapted from <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25314501">Brownlee, BMJ, 14 Aug 1915, p. 251</a>)
        </p>
        <p>
            Farr's letter explaiend how this reasoning applied to epidemics in
            humans, including cholera, diptheria, influenza, measles and
            smallpox.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this one shouldn't conclude that Farr thought that
            diseases should simply be allowed to run their course. He wrote:
            "When an epidemic disease of foreign origin enters a country it
            encounters difficulties of diffusion, and it is undoubtedly wise to
            throw obstacles in its way, so that it may pass through its phases
            within the narrowest possible circle."
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time Farr's letter was not well received. But by the early
            20th century Farr's thinking inspired several papers that tackled
            the mathematics of epidemics and led to our current ways of
            modelling epidemics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Gray_McKendrick">Anderson McKendrick</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Gray_McKendrick">William Kermack</a> in
            1927 articulated, albeit in a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rspa.1927.0118">very difficult paper</a>,
            what we now call the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, or SIR,
            model. A somewhat simpler <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/ebooks/berkeley-symposium-on-mathematical-statistics-and-probability/Proceedings-of-the-Third-Berkeley-Symposium-on-Mathematical-Statistics-and/chapter/Deterministic-and-Stochastic-Epidemics-in-Closed-Populations/bsmsp/1200502553">exposition of the SIR model</a>
            is given by David Kendall in 1956 .
        </p>

        <p>
            Farr's insight that epidemics roughly follow a normal curve was
            certainly useful. With the hindsight of over 100 years of
            epidemiological modelling, it may seem obvious. But as we shall see,
            with measles and Covid for example, matters are often not this
            simple. Also, even in the idealised SIR models we shall look at, the
            distributions are skewed to the right.

                    Thucydides, the Greek historian <a hef="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7142/pg7142-images.html">wrote</a> about the plague that
                    hit Athens in 430BC:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "[A] pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere
                    remembered. Neither were the physicians at first of any
                    service, ignorant as they were of the proper way to treat
                    it, but they died themselves the most thickly, as they
                    visited the sick most often; nor did any human art succeed
                    any better. Supplications in the temples, divinations, and
                    so forth were found equally futile, till the overwhelming
                    nature of the disaster at last put a stop to them
                    altogether."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Thucydides's description of the plague is worth reading.
                    It's a few pages long at the beginning of Chapter VII in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7142/pg7142-images.html">The
                    History of the Peloponnesian War</a>. His factual, detailed
                    description of the plague is remarkable. There is no resort
                    to the supernatural. One might call his account modern, but
                    for the fact that many modern accounts of epidemics are much
                    less accurate than Thucydides. Importantly, he understood,
                    and presumably the Athenians also did, that the disease was
                    contagious; it spread from person to person and those more
                    proximate to the infected were more likely to become sick.
                    Epidemiological modelling is impossible without
                    understanding this fundamental point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also remarkable is <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/23700/23700-h/23700-h.htm">The Decameron</a> of
                    Giovanni Boccaccio. It is set against the bubonic plague of
                    the mid-14th century. It perhaps remains the pandemic that
                    killed the greatest proportion of the human population.
                    Boccacio's writing is less factual and more inclinded to
                    invoke the supernatural than Thucydides. But it is also more
                    replete with beautiful literary flourishes. Europeans at
                    this time clearly understood that removing themselves from
                    the proximity of the ill reduced their risk of illness.
                    Indeed the ten protagonists of The Decameron did just this,
                    as they take shelter in a villa outside Florence in order to
                    escape the plague. (Because the plague was likely spread by
                    fleas, probably on rats, isolation was not a foolproof way
                    of escaping infection and death.)

        <p>
            There are many ways to model epidemics, but we can broadly divide
            models into two types: macro and micro. The former typically use a
            set of equations &mdash; either difference or differential ones
            &mdash; to calculate changes in a population, while the latter
            consist of numerous agents, each representing a person with their
            own specific behaviour. Macro models are often also called
            compartmental or equation-based, while micro models are often called
            agent-based or individual-based simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the onset of the Covid pandemic, many websites explained how SIR
            macro models worked. We'll start with that and then try to implement
            an equivalent micro model. We'll then discuss the differences
            between the two types of models and their consequences for
            understanding real-world epidemics. Then we'll implement models of
            HIV and Covid and consider what we can learn about these and other
            infectious diseases from macro and micro models.
        </p>

            <button type="button">Terminology</button>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Terminology is inconsistent across infectious disease
                    literature. For example, Macro, micro, compartmental, SIR,
                    equation-based, deterministic, stochastic: all are used to
                    describe types of models. I find the macro vs micro
                    distinction the most useful here, in part because the terms
                    are antonyms and using them in the source code makes
                    it easier to read. Also while macro models are usually
                    deterministic, they can be implemented stochastically. Micro
                    models can also be implemented deterministically, though a
                    use-case doesn't spring to mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Macro and micro models are broad categories and there are
                    all manner of models that borrow ideas from both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most part, I try to stick to terminology used in <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">An

        <h2>A very simple disease</h2>

        <p>
            We start off with a very simple infectious disease. It has the
            following characteristics:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                A population of at 1,000 people starts off with one infected
                person.
            </li>
            <li>
                Every person in the population is equally likely to be in
                contact with any one else in the population. We call this
                homogenous mixing. (Changing to heterogeneous mixing makes
                things much more complicated.)
            </li>
            <lI>When there are a tiny number of infected people in the
                population, they will on average infect two other people before
                they recover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Infected people on average take 5 days to recover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once recovered, a person has immunity. They can't become
                infected again and they can't transmit the infection to anyone
                else.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            No-one dies and there are no births or migration into or out of this
            population, at least for the time period that we model.
        </p>

        <p>
            Characteristic 3 of our model is what's commonly called
            $\underline{R}_0$, or the <em>basic reproduction number</em> in
            epidemiological literature. <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">Vynnycky and
            White</a> write: "$\underline{R}_0$ is defined as the average number
            of secondary infectious persons resulting from a typical infectious
            person following their introduction into a totally susceptible
            population".
        </p>

        <p>The real-world use of $\underline{R}_0$ is much more limited than is
            usually admitted but it's still useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            We call our description above a model world. We can implement both a
            macro or a micro model version of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this population we have people who are <b>S</b>usceptible to the
            infection, but not yet infected. There are infected people, and all
            infected people are also <b>I</b>nfectious. We also have <b>R</b>ecovered people.
            That's three compartments: Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered, abbreviated as SIR.
        </p>
        <p>
            We initialize our model so that nearly everyone in the population is
            uninfected and has never had the infection. In other words everyone
            is in the Susceptible compartment and a tiny number are in the
            Infectious compartment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's assume the population size is 1000. Then we'll set $S$, the
            number of people in the Susceptible compartment to 999 and $I$, the
            number of people in the Infectious compartment to 1. The number of
            people, $R$, in the Recovered compartment is 0. (Note we do not
            underline ${R}$, the number of recovered people, to differentiate it
            from $\underline{R}_0$, the number of people that each infectious
            person will infect when the epidemic is still very small. I wish
            this was a standard adopted throughout infectious disease
            literature.)
        </p>

        <p>
            All the above is common to both the macro and micro models that we
            implement. Now let's describe specific details of our macro model:
        </p>

        <h3>SIR Macro model using difference equations</h3>

        <p>
            We iteratively update the $S$, $I$ and $R$ compartments with the
            number of people who have moved between them. In our model each
            iteration represents a day in our infectious disease world. These
            equations describe what happens on each iteration:
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the number of people in our macro model compartments are
            continuous real numbers, not discrete. This is a big difference
            between our macro and micro models.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider two scenarios: (1) There are very few infected people in a
            population &mdash; nearly everyone is susceptible &mdash; versus (2)
            nearly everyone is infected &mdash; there are few susceptible
            people. In the former scenario, the infected people are much more
            likely to come into contact with susceptible people, infecting some
            of them. In the latter, since there are few susceptible people, the
            average infected person is less likely to come into contact with
            them.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's quite straightforward to capture this as an equation. The number
            of people who become infected on each iteration, or day, of our
            model is a function of S, I and the risk of infection $\lambda$.
            Since all three of these variables change with time, we subscript
            them. This equation describes the flow from $S$ to $I$:

            \begin{equation} S_{t+1}=S_t - \lambda_t S_t \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            So if 10 people are susceptible and 2 of them become infected on an
            iteration, $\lambda$ on that particular iteration is 0.2. But how do we update $\lambda$ on each iteration?
        </p>

        <p>
            Since people mix homogenously, we have:

            \begin{equation} \lambda_t = \beta I_t \end{equation}

            where

            \begin{equation} \beta = {\underline{R}_0 \over {ND}} \end{equation}

            where $N$ is the population size and $D$ is the average number of
            days a person is infected (5 in our model).
        </p>

        <p>
            The other equations in the model are simple:
        </p>
        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            I_{t+1}=I_t + \lambda_t S_t - rI_t
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            R_{t+1}=R_t + rI_t
            \end{equation}

            where $r$ is the rate of recovery per day, or $1/5$ in our model.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is an implementation of this model:
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="sir.svg" alt="Basic SIR graph">
        </p>


        <div id="macroSIR" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            There are four boxes shown in each model:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Outputs</dt>
            <dd>
                This shows the population size of each compartment after each
                iteration of a model.
            </dd>

            <dt>Parameters</dt>
            <dd>
                You can change the parameters before running a model. Press the <em>Reset</em> button
                to set the parameters to their original values. So for example, try increasing or
            </dd>

            <dt>Graph</dt>
            <dd>This shows how the compartment population sizes change over
                time.</dd>

            <dt>Population</dt>
            <dd>This shows the status of the individuals in the population. This
                makes much more sense for micro models. In macro models you usually
                have fractions of individuals, so we round off. Also our macro
                models are deterministics so all the individuals in a particular
                compartment are grouped together. </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            Adjust the speed slider to make the model run faster or slower.
        </p>

        <p>Click the <em>Run</em> button to run a model. It changes to a <em>Stop</em> button
            while the model is running so that you can interrupt the model. This
            is useful if it's taking too long.</p>


        <h3>Using differential equations</h3>

        <p>
            Modelling using difference equations is often adequate. But there is
            a problem. Let's change our model world so that our disease is
            highly infectious. Let's set $\underline{R}_0$ to 20. Now run the
            model. It goes horribly wrong. By day 5 the number of susceptible
            agents is negative, an impossible situation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason this has happened is because infections are happening so
            quickly that our timestep of 1 day is now too large. By day 5
            $\lambda$ becomes greater than 1, resulting in more infections
            occurring than the size of the suceptible population, which is
            absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two ways to fix such a problem. One would be to have each
            iteration represent a much smaller time unit. You'd have to change
            the value of $D$ appropriately. So if your timestep is 1/10th of a
            day, then $D$ is then set to 50 to represent our new model world.
        </p>
        <p>
            An alternative is to instead use differential equations. Difference
            equations calculate changes to compartments across discrete time
            steps, while a differential equation is continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
            Differential equations express the what the rates of change in
            compartments converge to as the time steps becomes tinier and
            tinier, getting closer and closer to zero. (A rudimentary calculus
            book can explain this better and in more depth. Also, the
            explanation in
            <a href="https://anintroductiontoinfectiousdiseasemodelling.com/">Vynnycky and
                White</a> is excellent.) Instead of using the subscript $t$
            in our notation, our equations are now functions of time.
        </p>

        <p>Recasting our difference equations as differential equations, we have:</p>

        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta I(t) S(t)
            \end{equation}


            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I(t) S(t) - r I(t)
            \end{equation}

            and

            \begin{equation}
            \frac{dR}{dt} =  r I(t)
            \end{equation}

        </p>

        <p>Here is an implementation of the model using differential equations.</p>

        <div id="macroSIROde" class="sir"></div>

        <p>If you run this as is, you end up with almost the same epidemic as
            with our difference equations. The differential equation model model
            converges on just under 80% of the population getting infected,
            while the difference equation version converged on just over 80%
            getting infected. If you were modelling a real world epidemic, it's
            unlikely you'd be bothered by this difference in results because the
            margins of error in the data and parameters are far greater than
            this.
        </p>
        <p>But setting $\underline{R}_0$ to 20, now obtains sensible results.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, even here there are limitations. Our differential
            equations are being solved using discrete computer hardware and must
            approximate solutions of continuous functions. The simple algorithm
            we use to solve our differential equations also breaks down if we
            set $\underline{R}_0$ to close to 3000 without reducing the time
            step. Of course such a high $\underline{R}_0$ is of no practical
            concern. $\underline{R}_0$

        <h3>SIR micro model</h3>

        <p>Now let's implement a micro model that approximates the above macro
            model.</p>

        <p>
            A micro model consists of agents and events. An agent typically
            represents a single person in a population. An event typically is
            executed on a subset of agents. There are different ways to implement
            micro models. The methodology described here is simple and fast.
        </p>

        <p> There are three stages to executing our micro models: <em>before</em>
            events, <em>during</em> events and <em>after</em> events.
        </p>
        <p>
            First execute the
            <em>before</em> events. These typically would create and initialise
            the agents, write a report of the initial state of the population
            and perhaps calculate some working variables that won't change once
            the simulation starts. </p>
        <p>
            Then iteratively execute the <em>during</em> events until some stop
            condition is met. As with our difference equation macro model, each
            iteration corresponds to our time step. A simple stop condition is
            simply to execute the during events $n$ times, where $n$ is a
            user-defined constant. Typical during events would shuffle the
            agents (to generate more stochasticity), infect some susceptibe
            agents, vaccinate some agents, recover some infected agents, or kill
            some ill agents.</p>
        <p>
            Finally execute the after events which would typically be writing a
            report or creating a CSV file of the outputs.
        </p>

        <p>Here is the structure of our micro models:</p>

        <pre>
Execute before events
# Simulation loop:
Loop n times:
   for each during event, e:
       For each agent, a:
           If e should be applied to a:
              e(a)
Execute after events
        </pre>

        <p>Here is a micro model for our simple model world.</p>

        <div id="microSIR" class="sir"></div>

        <p>Run the two SIR macro models and then run the micro model multiple
            times. What do you notice?</p>

        <p>
            Even with these simple models of our highly idealised model world,
            there are already interesting observations we can make:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The macro models obviously gives the same outputs every time.
                They're entirely deterministic. The micro model seldom repeats
                exactly the same outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the parameters used here, the infectious disease in the
                micro model often fails to take off; no one besides the
                originally infected agent becomes infected.
            </li>
            <li>
                The macro models end with about 80% of people in the
                recovery compartment. The micro model epidemic on average has
                far fewer infections. This is because with just one initial
                infection it often fails to "take off".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I ran the micro model 100 times. In some simulations, there are no
            new infections. The most number of infections in a simulation was
            856 infections, higher than the macro models. But the mean number of
            total infections across the simulations was only about 47%, much
            lower than the macro models. One thing of real-world consequence
            that this suggests is when an infected person enters a community of
            otherwise entirely uninfected people, there is a great deal of
            chance as to whether an epidemic will occur in that community.
        </p>

        <p>
            During Covid, there were many reports comparing why many people
            became infected in one geographic location versus another. Such
            speculation can be useful. The severity of an epidemic can be
            mitigated by timely rational action. But we should realise the role
            of chance; sometimes whether an epidemic explodes in one community
            and dissipates without much consequence in another is a matter of
            nature playing dice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are the difference equation SIR macro model (difference
            equations) and the SIR micro model again but with one difference:
            the number of infections in the initial population is 100 instead of
            1.
        </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    You could press the Run button on a micro model 100 times
                    and tabulate the outputs each time, but there's a much
                    easier way.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open an interactive Javascript console in your browser.
                        On Firefox or Chromium I press CTRL-SHIFT-C and then click
                        on the console tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then execute this code:
                        <pre>
series = EpiMicro.runSimulations(microSIR100, 100);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.min);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.max);
EpiMicro.stat(series, -1, 'R', EpiMicro.mean);
                        </pre>
                        The first line runs the microSIR100 model 100 times. The
                        next three lines get the min, max and mean of the final
                        value of the recoveries in the model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To change the initial values of the model's
                        compartments, you can do something like this:
                        <pre>
// Change the number of initial susceptible agents to 990
microSIR100.compartments.S = 990;
// Change the number of initial infected agents to 10
microSIR100.compartments.I = 10;
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To change the model's parameters, you can first view them like so:
                        <pre>
microSIR.parameters;
                        </pre>
                        And then modify them as appropriate.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    You can do the above with any of the models. All the model
                    names and their descriptions are stored in the
                    EpiUI.modelRegister variable. Obviously the macro models
                    give the same min, max and mean every time you run them.
                </p>
            </div>
        </aside>

        <p>
            Now running the micro model 100 times yields a mean of 843
            infections per simulation &mdash; you may get a slightly different
            answer each time you run it &mdash; about the same as the macro
            model's 842. The minimum number of infections in these 100
            simulations was 767 and the maximum was 892. Again, your outputs
            will likely differ a little.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tinker with the other parameters, $\underline{R}_0$ and $D$, to see
            how changing these changes the models' outputs.

                <h5>Matching the difference equation macro models</h5>
                <p>
                    I've tried to implement the micro models to match as
                    closely as possible the macro models that use difference
                    equations. The code makes certain compromises to do
                    this. For example, the $\lambda_t$ is calculated using
                    the number of infections at the end of the previous time
                    step, not the current number of infections which may
                    have changed as the infection event iterates over
                    agents. Other than for the purpose of trying to match
                    the models as closely as possible, I see no reason to do
                    this.
                </p>
                <h5>What programming language to use for micro models?</h5>
                <p>
                    There is far more debate on the Internet about which are the
                    best programming languages than the topic deserves. In fact,
                    there are many good programming languages and all of them
                    are flawed. Write your first simulations in a programming
                    language you feel comfortable with. If it's a prototype it
                    doesn't matter if it's Python, R, Ruby, Basic or whatever
                    your favourite algebra for expressing algorithms is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need your simulation to execute many thousands of
                    times and you are finding it too slow, changing to a
                    compiled language like C, C++, Go, Fortran, Rust, Java or
                    even a lisp-type language, may be necessary. But often the
                    cause of execution being too slow isn't the language but an
                    algorithm you might be using. Perhaps consider optimising or
                    improving an algorithm before going to the effort of
                    learning a new programming language.
                </p>
                <p>For what it's worth I tend to implement my micro models in
                    Python when I'm just prototyping and then C or C++ if I
                    truly need a lot more speed. But the models on this webpage
                    are of course all implemented in Javascript, because that is
                    the main programming language that the most popular web
                    browsers support.

        <h2><em><u>R</u><sub>0</sub></em>: Its uses and limits</h2>

        <p>
            Sometimes highly technical abstract mathematical concepts become
            part of the popular imagination. Perhaps the clearest example is
            Einstein's equation $E=MC^2$. During the first couple of years of
            Covid pandemic it was $\underline{R}_0$. While it is a helpful
            concept, it's usefulness has been somewhat overstated and it is
            often misunderstood.
        </p>

        <p>
            What exactly is $\underline{R}_0$? Imagine introducing a single
            infected person &mdash; the index case &mdash; into a community
            where every single person is susceptible. Moreover imagine that
            everyone has the same risk of infection and that everyone mixes
            randomly. In this idealised scenario the number of people infected
            by the index case is $\underline{R}_0$. In all real-world situation
            $\underline{R}_0$ is at most an approximation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following graphs are obtained by running the differential
            equation SIR model with different values of $\underline{R}_0$.
        </p>
        <figure id="fourR0graphs">
            <img src="fourGraphsOfR0.png" alt="Four graphs showing infections with different values of R0" />
            <figcaption>
                These graphs show the number of infections by week over 96 weeks
                with four different values of $\underline{R}_0$. From top to
                bottom the values of $\underline{R}_0$ are 1, 2, 4 and 8. The y-axis
                plots infections. The x-axis is the week number.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Note how the higher the value of $\underline{R}_0$, the higher the
            peak number of infections and the longer the epidemic's tail,
            rendering the curve less and less like the standard normal curve.
        </p>
        <p>
            $\underline{R}_0$ can be generalised to $\underline{R}_t$, the
            average number of people infected by an infected person on a
            specific timestep $t$. Given $\underline{R}_0$ and $s$, the
            proportion of the total population that remains susceptible, we have
            the following equation:
        </p>

        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            \underline{R_t} = s \underline{R_0}
            \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            The salient feature of $\underline{R_t}$ is that if it's below 1 the
            number of new cases is declining and if it's above 1 the number of
            new cases is increasing.
        </p>

        <p>
            A slight misconception during the Covid pandemic was to ascribe
            this feature to $\underline{R_0}$, instead of $\underline{R_t}$, but
            if $\underline{R_0}$ was below 1 there would have been no Covid
            pandemic. (I say "slight", because while people used the term
            $\underline{R_0}$, it was usually obvious in context that they were
            talking about $\underline{R_t}$ and such minor reductions in
            accuracy for the sake of simplicity are forgivable when explaining
            complex topics to the public.)
        </p>

        <p>
            A more serious misconception during the height of the pandemic was
            the concept of herd immunity. Many implied that once herd immunity
            was reached, that was pretty much the end of the epidemic. Putting
            aside that the SARS-CoV-2 virus keeps mutating, with the consequence
            that recovered people become susceptible again, even in its
            idealised meaning herd immuunity does not mean an epidemic has
            ended, or is even necessarily close to the end.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Herd Immunity Threshold is simply the peak of the above graphs.
            It is the proportion of the population which is immune when the
            number of new infections begins to decline, or when
            $\underline{R_t}$ goes below one, and is given by this equation:
        </p>

        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            1 - {1 \over \underline{R_0}}
            \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            Related to this is the proportion of the population that remains
            susceptible when $\underline{R_t}$ goes below one. This is simply
            the second term in the Herd Immunity Threshhold equation:
        </p>

        <p>
            \begin{equation}
            1 \over \underline{R_0}
            \end{equation}
        </p>


        <p>
            The Herd Immunity Threshold is the target proportion of the
            population vaccination programmes aims to reach to suppress an
            infectious disease, such as measles for example. During the height
            of the Covid pandemic, But the problem with \underline{R_0} and
            \underline{R_t} is that they are easy to define and calculate in our
            idealised SIR model. They are hard to calculate in micro models or
            even complex macro models. And they are extremely hard to estimate
            in real world epidemics, which usually progress in fits and starts
            and not the nice smooth curves of our macro models.

        <h2>Adding an exposure compartment</h2>

        <p>
            Let's get a bit more complicated. We change our model world so that
            there's an exposure compartment before an infectious one. When
            exposed a person is infected, but not infectious. In our model world
            the average exposure period is two days. This is an SEIR model.

        <h2>The measles cycle</h2>

        <p>Measles is an interesting but frustrating infectious disease to
            model. It shows that the story of infectious diseases can often be
            more complicated than the approximately normal curve trajectory that
            William Farr posited.
        </p>

        <p>
            This graph shows the oscillating nature of measles in England and
            Wales from 1950 to 1979. It is copied from
            <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7085179/">Fine and Clarkson, 1982</a> (<a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7085179/">full paper on Sci-hub</a>).
            Note how the epidemic returns approximately every two years. The
            arrow shows when the national measles vaccination programme was
            introduced, resulting in much smaller epidemics in subsequent years.
        </p>

                Source: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7085179/">Measles in England and Wales--I: An analysis of factors
                underlying seasonal patterns</a> by Fine and Clarkson, Int J
                Epidemiol. 1982 Mar;11(1):5-14. doi: 10.1093/ije/11.1.5.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            As Fine and Clarkson explained, there were two theories to try and
            explain this. One was that the measles virus mutated over time, with
            a consequent decline in immunity and resurrection of the epidemic.
            The other, now more accepted theory &mdash; but not without
            controversy because the data doesn't fit either theory as well as
            epidemiologists would like &mdash; is that never-before infected
            children entering schools provide a new susceptible population for
            the epidemic to spike. In between spikes, there are still measles
            cases, but in such low numbers that they largely go undetected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fine and Clarkson presented a set of difference equations, very
            similar to the SIR model. (Brian Williams has published useful <a href="http://www.ici3d.org/DAIDD2016/Materials/Brian%20Williams%20What%20is%20Science.pdf">slides</a>
            explaining various models, including this model.) I've implemented
            a model only superficially different to theirs.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are just three compartments: S, I and R. The infectious period
            is about 7 days. But this differs from the SIR model in that we
            increment S by the population growth rate, $\beta$ multipled by the
            population size, $N$. To keep our population size stable and to take
            into account that school children mainly mix with each other, we
            reduce the number in the R compartment by the same amount. (We set
            the population growth rate to approximately 2.5% per year.)
        </p>

        <p>Here are the difference equations:

            \begin{equation}
            I_{t+1} = \underline{R}_0 I_t {S_t \over N}
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            S_{t+1} = S_t - I_{t+1} + \beta N
            \end{equation}

            \begin{equation}
            R_t = R_t + I_t - \beta N
            \end{equation}
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a simple model but it's also unstable. Set $\underline{R}_0$
            a bit high and either $S$ or $R$ goes below zero and the model falls
            apart. So I've sligthly adapted the code for the above equations to
            not reduce $S$ or $R$ below zero. This keeps the model stable.
        </p>

        <div id="macroMeasles" class="sir"></div>

        <p>Notice the oscillations in measles cases every two or so years
            generated by the model. Adjust the value of $\beta$ and rerun the
            model to see how the oscillation period changes, &mdash; the 0.0009
            default is approximately 2% per annum adjusted to our two week time
            step. (It may be easier to view this graph by clicking on S and R in
            the graph legend, thus switching them off.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Also note that $\beta$ determines the osccilation period while
            $\underline{R}_0$ determines the peak number of infections.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the face of it, this appears to capture the dynamics of measles
            epidemics. But here is a nearly equivalent micro model version.
        </p>

        <div id="microMeasles" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            Notice how the epidemic disappears. This is because in the macro
            model, which uses continuous variables, the number of infections
            never quite gets to zero, so equation 17 is always a positive
            number, albeit often a very tiny one. This means the epidemic will
            eventually resurrect in the macro model. But infection in the micro
            model is an all or nothing discrete affair. An agent is either
            infected or not. Quite quickly, the number of infections declines to
            exactly zero, and the epidemic cannot resurrect itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've addressed this by creating a parameter, $r$, or Random
            Infections, that specifies the probability of randomly infecting an
            agent on each iteration. Try running the model with different value.
            The length of the period between epidemic peaks is determined by
            it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do these models capture the dynamics of the real-world situation or
            do we simply have a set of equations (or rules in the micro model)
            that happen to mirror the infection distribution of measles? Where,
            for instance, did all the measles go in the non-epidemic years? I
            don't know the answer, and the models don't tell us.
        </p>

        <h2>Pandemic flu and the quality of data</h2>

        <p>
            The 1918/19 global flu pandemic was one of the worst in history. The
            table below shows recorded deaths in India's Bombay Presidency.
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="RegisteredDeathsBombay-1918-1919.png" alt="Registered deaths in Bombay Presidency 1918-1919" />
            <figcaption>
                Source: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11617178/">The 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic &mdash; The Indian Experience</a> by ID Mills,
                Indian Econ Soc Hist Rev. 1986;23(1):1-40. doi: 10.1177/001946468602300102.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            This table is astonishing. First, the scale of death is hard to
            comprehend. If we assume the background death rate before the
            influenza struck in August 1918 was the average of May to July 1918
            then the number of recorded deaths due to the epidemic was well over
            1 million, most of those in just two months, October and November.
            Second, in 1918 the civil service &mdash; despite being hit by this
            massive disaster, as well as a world war that was already straining
            the Indian and British populations &mdash; was able to maintain
            death records with a completion rate that is still better than many
            countries in 2023. (Incidentally, the wave that struck Bombay in
            August 1918 was, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11617178/">Mills</a>,
            the second one. The first struck in June. It's unclear to me whether
            the absence of a spike in mortality in June and July is due to
            delayed reporting of deaths or that the first wave was not
            especially virulent, or some other reason.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Certainly no previous pandemic was chronicled in such quantitative
            depth. And yet estimating the number of global or even Indian deaths
            from the flu pandemic is hard and controversial. They range from
            fewer than 20 million to over 100 million, none totally implausible.
            (My own bias is towards the lower end of the scale.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's do some crude calculations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Bombay Presidency under the British Raj had a population of
                27 million or so according to the <a href="https://dspace.gipe.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10973/18950/GIPE-015153-Contents.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y">1911 census</a>,
                so let's say it was 30 million in 1918 on the eve of the
                pandemic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the above table, the excess deaths in the Bombay
                Presidency were 1.068 million. That gives a mortality of 3.8%.
            </li>
            <li>
                The global population in 1918 was about 1.8 billion. Projecting
                what happened in the Bombay Presidency to the planet, we get
                about 106 million deaths globally.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This is implausible. The Bombay Presidency is not a representative
            sample of what happened on average. Bombay was hit especially hard
            by the pandemic. Besides being overcrowded and people living in
            ghastly conditions, Bombay's docks served as a port for World War I
            soldiers. This traffic was quite possibly one of the main drivers of
            the epidemic. If anything, this shows that one must beware of crude
            calculations of pandemic deaths.

            "The [global death] burden [of the 1918/19 influenza pandemic] has
            been estimated many times over the past 100 years, and the estimated
            burden gradually has increased. One of the oldest estimates was made
            by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Epidemic%20Influenza%3A%20A%20Survey&author=EO%20Jordan&publication_year=1927&book=Epidemic%20Influenza%3A%20A%20Survey"> Jordan</a> in 1927, who estimated the global burden to be
            approximately 21.6 million deaths. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021692/">Patterson and Pyle</a>, in 1991,
            estimated the burden to be 30 million (ranging from 24.7 million to
            39.3 million). In 2002, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11875246/">Johnson and Mueller</a> reported
            a range of 50 million to 100 million deaths, with 50 million closer
            to the results from the studies they cited, and 100 million being
            the upper limit, because they believed 50 million to be an
            underestimate."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Spreeuwenberg et al. estimate just over 17 million deaths and not
            more than 25 million. "Our results suggest the global death impact
            of the 1918 pandemic was important but not as severe as most
            frequently cited estimates," they write.
        </p>

        <p>
            Estimating the number of deaths is difficult enough; estimating the
            number of infections is very much harder. And how does one even
            begin to estimate $\underline{R}_0$ with such imperfect data and
            such wide disagreement? The point here is not to weigh into this
            debate which would require considerable study and expertise. Rather
            it is to show how imperfect our knowledge is of the spread and
            number of deaths brought by infectious diseases.
        </p>

        <p>
            This remains true of epidemics today. The Economist has been
            attempting to <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates">estimate
            the number of excess deaths caused by Covid globally</a>. As of 28
            February 2023, the authors state: "We find that there is a 95%
            chance that the true value lies between 16.5m and 27.2m additional
            deaths." Besides being a wide range of the number of deaths of the
            most documented and studied pandemic in history, one is struck, when
            delving into their analysis, by the poor quality of data from many
            countries.
        </p>

        <p>
            If we compare The Economist analysis to the lower bound 1918 flu
            mortality estimates, it is possible that Covid may have killed more
            people. But the global population is about four times greater now
            and, also, the age distribution of Covid deaths was very much older
            than the flu pandemic. That the death tolls from the 1918/19
            influenze pandemic and Covid are catastrophically high is
            indisputable. But precise estimates should be treated with great
            caution. The same can be said for the Antonine Plague (165-180AD),
            the Justinian Plague (541-549AD), the Black Death (1346-1353),
            smallpox through the aeons, tuberculosis through the millenia, HIV
            over the past 40 years, and a whole bunch of other infectious
            maladies. Modellers should be modest.

        <h2>
            Modelling when to start HIV treatment
        </h2>

        <p>
            In the late 2000s there was a feisty discussion about the optimal
            time for people HIV to start antiretroviral treatment.
            Antiretroviral pills taken daily for life reduce the number of HIV
            virions in the blood of infected people, usually to undetectable
            levels. This brings two advantages: (1) it extends life-expectancy
            to almost normal and (2) it reduces the risk of transmitting the
            virus to others, though this was not known with much confidence
            until a large clinical trial confirmed it in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideal time to start treatment wasn't clear because of three
            concerns: (1) the side effects of the drugs, (2) if drug resistance
            developed quickly a person would lose the benefit of the drug
            regimen, so starting later might extend the period of drug
            efficacy longer, and (3) the cost of the drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the mid 20-teens large well-conducted clinical trials had shown
            the benefit of starting treatment as soon as a person was diagnosed
            were substantial. Moreover drug resistance and serious side effects
            with newer antiretroviral regimens have become minor problems.
        </p>

        <p> Nevertheless in the late 2000s all of this was unclear. World Health
            Organisation researchers (Granich et al. 2009) published models in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673608616979">The Lancet</a> that
            showed that a policy of actively testing and immediately treating
            people with HIV in South Africa, the state with the most number of
            people with this virus in the world, would reduce the country's HIV
            prevalence to a negligible level in 50 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The paper certainly made a splash, evoking voiceferous discussion.
            According to Google Scholar it has been cited over 2,300 times. I
            suspect that until the Covid pandemic it was the most highly
            cited infectious disease model ever.

            This is a much more complex model than our SEIR or measles ones. It
            accounts for population growth and deaths. The model specification
            has 10 compartments and another 10 parameters. Here is a macro model
            (using difference equations) implementation of Granich et al.
        </p>

        <div id="macroGranichEtAl" class="sir"></div>

        <p>
            In the results table, the total number of infections (the sum of
            compartments I1 through I4 and A1 through A4) is tracked in the
            column with the heading I. Try adjusting the parameters and
            rerunning the model to see how the course of the epidemic changes,
            particularly the S (susceptibles), D (deaths) and I (infections) columns.
        </p>

        <p>We can quite easily implement a microsimulation version of this.</p>

        <p>
            While I have done my best to match the two models, the course of the
            epidemic is now highly non-linear and near-perfect matching like in
            the SIR and SEIR models doesn't seem possible. Nevertheless, in
            infectious disease modelling we are seldom, if ever, interested in
            precise predictions; we merely hope for plausible approximations. So
            the differences between the outputs of the two models appear to be
            inconsequential.
